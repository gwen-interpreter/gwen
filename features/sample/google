@StepDef
Scenario: I have Google in my browser

          Gwen will match the name of this step def to the first step
          in the feature above and evaluate the steps that follow. These
          steps are matched against predefined steps in the Gwen Web DSL
          to perform browser operations for you at runtime.

    Given I start a new browser
     When I navigate to "http://www.google.com"
     Then the page title should be "Google"
