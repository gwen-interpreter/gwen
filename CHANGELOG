======
June 22, 2021
- Report portal integration release
- Add `nodePath` and `sourceRef` options to `gwen.rp.testCaseId.keys` setting to support
  generating test case ID's based on node path or source reference only.
June 7, 2021 - 2.33.0-rc-rp.2
- Fix name clash between parameters and attributes in interpolator
- Convert back slashes in sourceRef and nodePath to forward slashes on Windows
- Send sourceRef as item attribute in report portal if it is less than or equal to 128 
  characeters in length, otherwise append it to the item description instead.
- Enforce case sensitivity on all report portal setting names.
- Improved test case ID generation for nodePath+params mode:
  - Remove all keywords from node paths and use node names only
  - Remove table cooridnates and `Examples` keyword from expanded scenario names in outlines
  - Use single dimension occurrence in node path of ForEach, While, and Until iterations
  - Pass cumulative parameters to report portal 
    - Incuding current parameters and all those previously visible in the call chain
- Remove node path logging on node descriptions
- Introduce new setting `gwen.rp.debug=true|false` to control whether or not
  to log debug messages containing the node path and parameters for all nodes
  in report portal. Default is false.
May 31, 2021 - 2.33.0-rc-rp.1
- Fix duplicate launch histories in RP for scenario outlines
- Send table row data associated with expanded scenarios of outlines to report portal as parameters
- Send all parameters passed to stepdefs to report portal as parameters
- Introduce node paths and use those in conjunction with parameters sent to report portal 
  to generate unique test case IDs (SHA 256 hashes) for all nodes in RP instead of relying on 
  the default auto generation based on line numbers in codeRefs. This ensures that history 
  in RP remains in tact for nodes if their line numbers change (as long as nodes are not 
  renamed and identically named sibling nodes are not deleted).
- Add new configuration settings to control how test case IDs are generated in report portal:
  - `gwen.rp.testCaseId.keys = nodePath+params | sourceRef+params | auto`
  - Default is `nodePath+params`
- Append source refs and node paths to descriptions of nodes in report portal
  - Do not send source refs as attributes 
  - This is to avoid 128 char limit on attributes in RP
- Remove support for @TestCaseId annotation which was previously implemented on an invalid assumption
- Drop column number from sourceRef string representation and codeRef sent to report portal
- Ensure attachments are still logged in report portal when step def reporting is disabled

      - *Given* steps must set context
      - *When* steps must perform actions
      - *Then* steps must perform assertions

2.24.0
======
January 29, 2020
- Add assocative meta setting:
  - `gwen.associative.meta=true|false` (default is false)
  - If enabled, then if a meta file has the same name (excluding file extension) and is 
    in the same location as a feature, then load that meta last for that feature only and skip over 
    all other meta in the path to the feature that is assocaited in same way to any other features. 
    This enables users to define meta that is bound to one feature only by defininig it in a meta 
    file in the same location as the feature and naming it with the same name as the feature but 
    with the .meta extension instead (handy for cases where a meta per feature is desirable).
  - This setting is only honoured if `gwen.auto.discover.meta` is enabled (which it is by default).

2.23.0
======
January 21, 2020
- Introduce "declarative" mode for features to prevent the user of imperative

  State levels are configurable with the `gwen.state.level` setting which can be set to:
  - `feature`: to give each feature a state that is shared across scenarios (default)
  - `scenario`: to give each scenario a new state that is not shared across scenarios
- The `--parallel` option now runs:
  - features in parallel when configured state level is `feature`
  - scenarios in parallel when the configured state level is `scenario`
- Added `--parallel-features` command line option to force parallel feature execution
  regardless of state level
- Input CSV data records are now resolved to Backgrounds instead of top level Scenarios
  to support both feature and scenario level states

2.21.0
======
November 12, 2019
- Integated latest Gherkin 8.1.1 parser from Cucumber to support rules and 
  [example mapping](https://cucumber.io/blog/2015/12/08/example-mapping-introduction)

=====
Feb 29, 2016, 8:50 PM GMT+11 (AEDT)
- Added support for configuring a ramp up interval (in seconds) for 
  staggered parallel execution ~ for user request issue #18. The 
  interval can be set through the `gwen.rampup.interval.seconds` setting
  This setting is only applicable for parallel execution mode. If it is 
  not set or is set to zero, then no staggering will occur (as per default 
  behavior). 
- Added new `gwen.report.suppress.meta` setting for controlling whether or 
  not meta reports should be generated with HTML reports (default value is 
  false). If you have a lot of meta, suppressing the meta reports can 
  save a lot of disk space. Enabling this setting does not suppress the 
  hyperlinked stepdefs in feature reports (they will always be rendered).
